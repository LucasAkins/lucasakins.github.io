# About Me
## My Interests
1. Making cocktails for friends as well as bar patrons. I'm a full-time bartender so I like to practice making new drinks on my friends before I serve them for guests at my bar.
2. Learning new submissions, takedowns, and sweeps in Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu. I have been training BJJ for nearly 5 years, so expanding my arsenal of attacks and escapes and perfecting them has become one of my favorite things to do in my free time,  
3. Playing video games such as Fortnite, Team Fortress 2, and Pokemon. I grew up playing on Nintendo consoles, so Pokemon will always have a place in my heart. Team Fortress 2 was the first game that I discovered when I got a desktop in middle school, and I still play it to this day. Fortnite is the one game I want to stop playing, but at this point, I think I am addicted. I recently bought a new gaming PC to replace my old one because the game didn't perform as well as it used to. 

## Websites that I frequent
1.[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)
	I often use YouTube to watch content on my interests in my free time. YouTube has plenty of tutorials on building certain cocktails I have not made before, videos on how to drill a new move in BJJ, and gaming content from some of my favorite creators. This site also has a "Shorts" feature, similar to how TikTok and Instagram Reels work, which is great to use when you don't know what to watch. 

2.[Netflix](https://www.netflix.com)
	Netflix is a movie and show streaming service that was a staple of my childhood. Having access to 6,621 movies, and over half of those being exclusive to this service means you'll have a hard time _not_ being able to find something to watch. Netflix allows you to download movies and shows to your device so you can stream them without an internet connection, which can be useful on road trips, flights, or simply when your data or internet kicks.

3.[BlackBoard](https://www.blackboard.waketech.edu)
	This last one we should all be familiar with, as it is the website we use to access our classes! Blackboard acts as a portal for students to enter and complete their classwork for school. Knowing how to access this site is crucial for all of us, as we would fail our classes if we did not!
