	<h1>My name is Lucas Akins!</h1>
	<p> I am a first-year college student, and I am currently taking classes at Wake Technical Community College. This is my first computer-related class, and I intend to enter cybersecurity. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games such as Pokemon, Fortnite, and Minecraft Dungeons. I spend a lot of my time with my significant other, hanging out with her and her cats. We like to go to the gym together and check out cool bars and breweries! </p>
